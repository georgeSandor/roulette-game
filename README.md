Roulette Casino Game

Welcome to the Roulette Casino Game, a simple and interactive roulette game built with React and TypeScript. In this game, players can place bets on numbers, and the roulette will spin to determine if the player wins or loses. The game includes a betting system with various bet amounts and tracks the player's money.

Features

Interactive Roulette Board: Players can select a number between 1 and 36.
Betting System: Players can place bets of $5, $10, $25, $50, or $100.
Money Management: The player starts with $1000. Bets are subtracted from the total, and winnings are added.
Win or Lose: The roulette spins, and if the selected number matches the result, the player wins double their bet.
Game Over: If the player's money reaches $0, the game ends, and no further bets can be placed.
Reset Game: Players can reset the game at any time to start fresh.
